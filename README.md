# Maui.PasswordMeter

## A simple demo of a password strength meter built in .NET MAUI.

**NOTE:** The demo does not currently work on Windows due to a bug with the ProgressBar control (see https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/3383 and https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/3479).    
    

Works on iOS, macOS and Android.
